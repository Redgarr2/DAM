## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

DAM is built with a modular 7-crate Rust architecture:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schema/      # Shared types and error handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ingest/      # File processing and preview generation  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ process/     # AI services (transcription, tagging, generation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index/       # Search engine (text + vector)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/          # Tauri desktop application (PRIMARY INTERFACE)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/      # Optional LAN sharing server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ versioning/  # Git-based version control
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestrator/ # Task coordination
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.75 or later
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 16+ (for building the desktop app)

### Installation & Launch

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Redgarr2/DAM.git
   cd DAM
   ```

2. **Launch the desktop application**
   ```bash
   cd crates/ui
   cargo tauri dev
   ```

   A native desktop window will open with the DAM interface!

3. **Or build a portable executable**
   ```bash
   cd crates/ui
   cargo tauri build --release
   ```
   
   Find your portable `.exe` in `src-tauri/target/release/`

### First Import

1. The desktop application opens automatically
2. Click "Import Files" in the interface
3. Select files or directories using the native file dialog
4. Watch DAM recursively scan and import all your assets!

## üìÅ Usage Examples

### Desktop Application Interface
- **Import Assets**: Use "Import Files" button with native file dialogs
- **Directory Scanning**: Select any folder to recursively import all supported files
- **Search**: Use the search bar for text or semantic similarity search
- **Library Management**: View statistics and organize your collection

### Search Your Assets
- **Text search**: "vacation photos"
- **Semantic search**: "red car" (finds red cars even without those exact words)
- **File type filters**: Search within specific asset types
- **AI-powered**: Finds content by meaning, not just filename

### Build Distribution
```bash
# Create portable executable
cd crates/ui
cargo tauri build --release

# The executable will be in src-tauri/target/release/
# Copy anywhere and run - no installation needed!
```

## üîß Configuration

### AI Models (Optional)
Download AI models for enhanced features:
- **Whisper**: Place whisper models in `models/whisper/`
- **CLIP**: Place CLIP models in `models/clip/`
- **Stable Diffusion**: Place SD models in `models/sd/`

### Storage
- **Assets**: Original files remain in place
- **Index**: Search data stored in `data/index/`
- **Previews**: Generated thumbnails in `previews/`
- **Portable**: All data folders created relative to executable

## üèõÔ∏è Technical Details

### Desktop Application
- **Framework**: Tauri 2.0 for native desktop experience
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS embedded in native window
- **Backend**: Pure Rust with full access to system APIs
- **Distribution**: Single executable with embedded assets

### Performance
- **Async Architecture**: Tokio-based concurrent processing
- **Memory Safe**: Rust's ownership system prevents crashes
- **Scalable**: Handles thousands of assets efficiently
